# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
I wanted to add the lights to the bird to make it look more interesting. I also made it so the bird always moves the appropriate amount to make it through the maze. At one point the bird kept bumping into the side of the wall so I had to make it turn more than 90 degrees on that turn to avoid that.
## Challenges faced and solutions
The biggest challenges I faced was the bird kept bumping into things. I was able to fix this through trial and error by changes things such as the distance it moved or the amount it turned.
## Future enhancements
Currently the bird has to start in the right position or else it will bump into something and fail. In the future I could enhance it to make it so that the regardless of the position it starts in, it could still navigate through the maze without failing.
